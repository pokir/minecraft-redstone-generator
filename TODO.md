# Todo list

- Multi-bit operations
- Outputting to redstone lamps
- Syntax checker before compiling
  - Only [a-zA-Z0-9\_] for variable names
  - Only valid operations/components
- Make sure all variables are unique, including those made by COMPONENTS
- Way to minimize useless repetition in components (reuse previous lines?)
- Chat message cache (to use up arrow instead of typing it all out)
  - Or copy paste
  - Or schematic
